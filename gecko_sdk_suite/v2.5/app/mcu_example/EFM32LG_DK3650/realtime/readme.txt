Segger emWin example - dynamic graph update.

This example project uses the emWin library from Segger. emWin 
is an efficient, modular, processor- and LCD controller-independent graphical 
user interface (GUI) library.

In this example, the user can perform touch panel calibration and then
perform touch panel operations to configure the GUI while graphs are 
continuously updated.
