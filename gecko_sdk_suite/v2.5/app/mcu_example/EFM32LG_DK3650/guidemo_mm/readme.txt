emWin example - show gui functionality - energy efficient.

This example project uses the emWin library maintaining
low power consumption.

TFT driver is controlled in so called "Memory Map"
configuration, where internal RAM of TFT controller 
is used. There is no additional framebuffer needed 
so this example could be run in small RAM footprint 
systems.

Simple application showing different visual effects
which could be achieved by means of emWin.
