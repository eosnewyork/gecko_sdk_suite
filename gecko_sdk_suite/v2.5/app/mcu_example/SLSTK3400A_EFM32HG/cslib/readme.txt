CSLIB example. Template for new projects.

This example project uses the capacitive sensing firmware library to sample
capacitive sensing buttons on the STK.  Real-time sample information, touch
qualification status, and other state variables can be displayed and examined
in the Capacitive Sensing Profiler tool.
