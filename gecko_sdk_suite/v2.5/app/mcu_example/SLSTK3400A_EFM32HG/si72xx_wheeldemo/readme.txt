Hall effect demo code for the Si72xx-WD-Kit using a Silicon Labs
SLSTK3400A-EFM32HG Starter Kit.

You must have the Hall Effect Evaluation kit, Si72xx-WD-Kit, to make use of
this demo. The Si72xx-WD-Kit includes two Si7210 sensors mounted on an 
expansion board (Si72xx-EXP) plus each of the six base part types mounted on 
small postage-stamp-sized (PS) boards. You must use the Silicon Labs 
SLSTK3400A-EFM32HG Starter Kit which is included in the Si72xx-WD-Kit.

This example includes eight demos, two for the Si72xx-EXP and one for each of 
the PS-boards. Individual files are included to measure and convert the sensor 
outputs into magnetic field readings for the Si7211-EB, Si7212-EB and Si7213-EB
boards. The Si72xx-EXP and Si7210-EB boards use the Silicon Labs Hall Effect 
Sensor driver to demonstrate the sensor's features by communicating over I2C. 

Note: For a complete list of the demos and their descriptions, please reference
the Si72xx-WD-Kit User's Guide, UG288.
