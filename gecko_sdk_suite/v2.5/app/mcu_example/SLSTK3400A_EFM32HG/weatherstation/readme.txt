Weatherstation using the Sensor add-on board on the SLSTK3400A_EFM32HG.

This example project uses the EFM32 CMSIS including EMLIB and the
board support package support functions/drivers to demonstrate driving
the Sharp Memory LCD display on the SLSTK3400A_EFM32HG kit. In addition, it
demonstrates the use of Silabs I2C based sensors on the expansion board
header.

You must have a Silabs Sensor add-on board to make use of this demo.
Once the demo is started, hold your hand over the gesture sensor. Once
the sensor detects your hand the display will become active.

Swipe left and right over the sensor to scroll through temperature, humidity
and UV index. On the temperature screen, you can swipe up or down to change
between Fahrenheit or Celcius.

Note: Due to the size of this example, you might need to enable compiler
optimizations to be able to fit the entire binary in the 32k of flash!
