Select a single energy mode, and stay there.

This example project uses the EFM32 EMLIB and demonstrates the use of
the LCD controller, RTC (real time counter), GPIO and various Energy
Modes (EM).

The user can press the push buttons PB0 and PB1 to select which energy
mode to demonstrate.

This demo application has been made to give a quick demo of the
Energy Profiler from Silicon Labs and to reproduce the different 
energy modes seen in the EFM32 datasheet current consumption table.
