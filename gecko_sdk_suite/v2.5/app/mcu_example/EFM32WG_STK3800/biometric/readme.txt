Biometric Demo using the Biometric Sensor add-on board for the EFM32WG STK3800.

This example project uses the EFM32 CMSIS including EMLIB and the
board support package support functions/drivers to demonstrate driving
the LCD display on the EFM32WG_STK3800 kit. In addition, it demonstrates the 
use of Silicon Labs I2C based sensors on the expansion board header.

You must have a Silicon Labs Biometric Sensor add-on board to make use of this demo.
Once the demo is started, push button PB0 to change what is displayed. While
