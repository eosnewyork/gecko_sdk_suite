EZRadio Unmodulated Carrier transmission example using the EZRadio device in 
the EZR32 device.

This example project uses the EZR32WG CMSIS including EMLIB, emdrv and the
board support package support functions/drivers to demonstrate driving
the EZRadio or EZRadioPRO device in the EZR32 device.

The user can start CW transmission by pressing the PB0 button. 
Ceasing the transmission can be issued by pressing the PB0 button again.

The sample app is able to consume radio configuration header files generated
with either Simplicity Studio or Wireless Development Suite. The generated
configuration is consumed automatically in Simplicity Studio. In order to use
the generated header file instead of the default one with other toolchains enable
RADIO_USE_GENERATED_CONFIGURATION in ezradio_plugin_manager.h.

For more information please refer to the Quick Start Guide of the application.
