Peripheral control example.

This example project use EFM32 CMSIS and the EMLIB peripheral library to
demonstrate how to enable the access to various on-board peripherals. To
reduce leakage current, the EFM32WG-DK3850 board has several analog switches, and to
enable extended functionality there are multiplexers which need to be
configured correctly for most of the kit peripherals.

The on-board LEDs will light up according to the configured state of the
peripherals.
