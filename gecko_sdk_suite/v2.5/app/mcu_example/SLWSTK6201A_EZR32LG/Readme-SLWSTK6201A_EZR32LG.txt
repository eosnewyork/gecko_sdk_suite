====== Kit Examples ======

This package include examples for the SLWSTK6201A_EZR32LG radio development
kit from Silicon Labs.
The SLWSTK6201A_EZR32LG device is a 434MHz radio with +10dBm output.

====== Dependencies ======

This package _requires_ the EM_BSP_COMMON and the CMSIS packages to be
installed at the same level as this package. If you did not get this as part
of the Simplicity Studio application, you should also download and install the
CMSIS package. See the Changes file for required version.

The CMSIS package requires C99 support, and so does this package.
