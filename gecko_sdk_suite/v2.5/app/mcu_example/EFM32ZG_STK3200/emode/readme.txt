Select a single energy mode, and stay there.

This example project uses the EFM32 EMLIB and demonstrates the use of
the LCD display, RTC (real time counter), GPIO and various Energy
Modes (EM).

Use PB1 to cycle through the energy mode tests available.
Press PB0 to start selected test.

This demo application has been made to give a quick demo of the
Energy Profiler from Silicon Labs and to reproduce the different 
energy modes seen in the EFM32 datasheet current consumption table.
