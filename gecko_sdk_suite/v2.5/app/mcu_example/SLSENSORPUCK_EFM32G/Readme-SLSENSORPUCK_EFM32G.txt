====== Kit Examples ======

This package include examples for the SLSENSORPUCK_EFM32G development
kit from Silicon Labs.

====== Dependencies ======

This package _requires_ the EM_BSP_COMMON and CMSIS packages to be
installed at the same level as this package. If you did not get this as part
of the Simplicity Studio application, you should also download and install the
CMSIS package. See the Changes file for required version.

The CMSIS package requires C99 support, and so does this package.

====== File structure ======

   Configuration data for BSP and Drivers in EM_BSP_COMMON.
