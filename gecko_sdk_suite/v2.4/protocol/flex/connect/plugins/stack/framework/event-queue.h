 * @addtogroup event
 *
 * @{

 * An event queue is a queue of events that will be run at some future time(s).
 * The Event type is declared in core/ember-stack.h and has three fields:
 *
   @verbatim
   EventActions *actions;      // See below.
   Event *next;                // Internal use only, but must be
                 // Initialized to NULL.
   uint32_t timeToExecute;     // Internal use only.
   @endverbatim
 *
 * The EventAction structure also has three fields:
 *
   @verbatim
   struct EventQueue_s *queue; // The queue this event goes on.
   void (*handler)(Event *);   // Called when the event fires.
   void (*marker)(Event *);    // A marking fuction, can be NULL.
   @endverbatim
 *
 * The marker function is needed if an event refers to a buffer or is
 * itself a buffer. See the dynamic event example below.
 *
 *
 * Sample static event declaration:
 *
   @verbatim
   static void fooEventHandler(Event *event);
   static EventActions fooEventActions = {
   &emStackEventQueue,
   fooEventHandler,
   NULL          // No marking function is needed
   };

   Initializes the event as unscheduled.
   static Event fooEvent = { &fooEventActions, NULL };

   static void fooEventHandler(Event *event)
   {
   ...
   }
   @endverbatim
 *
 * Sample dynamic event:
   @verbatim

   typedef struct {
   Event event;
   PacketHeader someBuffer;
   // plus other values as needed
   } BarEvent;

   static void barEventHandler(BarEvent *event);
   static void barEventMarker(BarEvent *event);

   static EventActions barEventActions = {
   &emStackEventQueue,
   (void (*)(Event *)) barEventHandler,
   (void (*)(Event *)) barEventMarker
   };

   static void barEventHandler(BarEvent *event)
   {
   ...
   };

   static void barEventMarker(BarEvent *event)
   {
   emMarkBuffer(&event->someBuffer);
   }

   static void addBarEvent(Buffer someBuffer, uint32_t delayMs)
   {
   Buffer eventBuffer = emAllocateBuffer(sizeof(BarEvent));
   if (eventBuffer == NULL_BUFFER) {
     return;
   }
   BarEvent *barEvent = (BarEvent *) emGetBufferPointer(eventBuffer);
   barEvent->event.actions = &barEventActions;
   barEvent->event.next = NULL;       // initialize as unscheduled
   barEvent->someBuffer = someBuffer;
   emberEventSetDelayMs((Event *) barEvent, delayMs);
   }
   @endverbatim

 * Cancelling a dynamic event:
   @verbatim

   static bool barEventPredicate(Event *event,
                                  void *castBuffer)
   {
   return (((BarEvent *) event)->someBuffer) == (Buffer) castBuffer;
   }

   static void cancelBarEvent(Buffer someBuffer)
   {
   emberFindEvent(&emStackEventQueue,
                  &barEventActions,
                  barEventPredicate,
                  (void *) someBuffer);
   }
   @endverbatim
 * Delays greater than this will cause the scheduled execution time to
 * wrap around into the past and the event will be executed immediately.
